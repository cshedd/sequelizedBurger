Sequelized-Burger

This app uses Sequelize instead of MySQL for my Burger App.

-All references to vanilla MySQL have been removed and replaced with Sequelize queries.

-Remove old ORM file and references in burgers_controller.js and replace with Sequelize's ORM methods.

-Edit config.json to include database configuration.

Should function just as the MySQL Burder App does!
